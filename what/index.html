<h1>what we can do with Squirm</h1>

<h2>Current situation:</h2>
<p>
Basic Squirm has no concept of control. There are rules that say where a cell
can and cannot move to but no rules that say which choice to make. In the applet
on the <i>how Squirm works</i> page the cells choose
at random from the moves available to them.
<p>
The applet on the Squirm front page, however, demonstrates two types of behaviour. The
large creature (400 cells) moves at random while the small creature (9 cells) heads
steadily downwards. This is one of the simplest non-random behaviours that can be 
implemented - where a cell has a choice of squares to move to, it chooses the one that is 
nearest the bottom. 
<p>
An even simpler behaviour is for each cell not to move at all - this results in static blocks
of cells that act as obstacles for other creatures.
<p>
Explore the Squirm worlds from the front page, send in suggestions for Squirm worlds you want to 
see. Hopefully soon the Squirm applets will be controllable, so you can play with different
configurations yourself.
<p>
<h2>Future directions:</h2>
<p>
Consider that at every time step each and every cell has a choice of where to move to (or whether
to stay still). Different tactics give vastly different overall behaviours. Imagine the strategy
being different for different parts of a creature, or for the strategy to be decided on the fly
by a central brain, or in response to local stimuli such as the presence of enemies. Imagine the 
control being evolved over time, with the most successful strategies being retained.
<p>
Squirm as it stands at the moment is more of a framework for a potential artificial life simulator
than anything else. It demonstrates how flexibility of form can be achieved in a computationally
efficient manner.

The java source for Squirm is available here: <a href="squirm.zip">squirm.zip</a> (7k). Compile using Sun's JDK (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/">http://java.sun.com/products/</a>) with the command <b>javac *.java</b> and then load the html file into a java-enabled browser.
