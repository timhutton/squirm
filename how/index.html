<h1>how Squirm works</h1>

<p>
Squirm is a variant of Conway's Game of Life. 
<p>
Squirm attempts to model simple amoeba-like creatures by enforcing cell adhesion
rules on a square grid.
</p>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<p>
Squirm works on a square grid, with each square either containing a cell or 
being empty. Each cell belongs to one creature.
<p>
At each time step, every cell can either stay where it is or move to one
of the empty squares around it (if there are any).
<p>
Squirm creatures stick together, their cells don't fly apart. This is enforced by only 
allowing moves that maintain 4-connectivity. Here are some examples:
<p>

<font face="impact">
<center>
<table width=100 height=100>
<tr><td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>1<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>2<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>3
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>0<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>8<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>4
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>7<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>6<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>5
</table>
</center>
</font>
<p>
In the grid above the centre cell (8) has two neighbours (1 and 2). The squares 0,3,4,5,6,7
are empty, but only a move to square 0 or square 3 keeps the cells connected.
<p>
<font face="impact">
<center>
<table width=100 height=100>
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>1<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>2<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>3
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>0<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>8<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>4
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>7<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>6<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>5
</table>
</center>
</font>
<p>
In the above example the only valid moves are to square 1 or square 6.
<p>
<font face="impact">
<center>
<table width=100 height=100>
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>1<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>2<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>3
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>0<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>8<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>4
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>7<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>6<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>5
</table>
</center>
</font>
<p>
In this example, any move of the centre cell would leave the cells unconnected, so this
cell is unable to move.
<p>
<font face="impact">
<center>
<table width=100 height=100>
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>1<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>2<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>3
<tr><td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>0<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>8<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>4
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>7<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>6<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>5
</table>
</center>
</font>
<p>
In this example, the cell (in square 8) has one neighbour (0). The cell in square 5
is not connected to the cell in square 8 and is ignored. Valid moves are: 1,7.
<p>
The following algorithm implements the rules:

<ol>
<li><p>find all the cells connected to the centre one (connected means next to it or next to a connected
cell).</p>
<li><p>try moving to each empty square, find the cells that are now connected to our cell.</p>
<li><p>if there are <i>any</i> cells not connected now that were connected before then this
move is not valid.</p>
</ol>
<p>
Here is a worked example:
<p>
<font face="impact">
<center>
<table width=100 height=100>
<tr><td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>1<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>2<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>3
<tr><td bgcolor="beige" align=center>0<td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>8<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>4
<tr><td bgcolor="chocolate" align=center>7<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>6<td bgcolor="beige" align=center>5
</table>
</center>
</font>
<p>
initially_connected = { 1, 2 }
<p>
empty squares = { 0, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
<p>
A move to square 0 leaves 1,2,7 connected, none unconnected. There are none now unconnected that
were connected before hence this move is valid.
<p>
A move to square 3 leaves 1,2 connected, 7 unconnected. The only unconnected cell (7) was not connected
before hence this move is valid.
<p>
A move to squares 4 or 5 leaves 1,2,7 unconnected. Of these, 1 and 2 were connected before, hence 
this move is not valid.
<p>
A move to square 6 leaves 7 connected, 1,2 unconnected. There are cells now unconnected that
were connected before hence this move is invalid.
<p>
There are therefore 2 valid places to move to: square 0 or square 3.
<p>

<h2>Applying The Rules</h2>
<p>
The rules determine where a cell can move to, based on what is within the 3x3 neighbourhood.
The aim is to maintain connectivity within each creature, so the rules only apply to the
cells that belong to the creature the centre cell is a member of. Any cells of a different
creature within the area are treated as obstacles - the cell cannot move to a square occupied 
by the cell of a different creature (or indeed its own).
<p>
One by one the cells in the world get a chance to move. Where there are multiple moves
available to a cell it chooses at random (although other strategies are possible, as we
will see).
<p>
Below is a running applet containing a simple Squirm world. The world has three creatures
with 5, 10 and 15 cells.

If nothing is happening above then your browser is not enabled to show java applets. Try using
a different browser or changing your browser settings.
<p>
In this example, each creature has its own colour. Hit Reload/Refresh in your browser 
to restart the simulation with different colours.
<p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>
The rules are having the effect intended, that the creatures are amazingly flexible and
reconfigurable without the cells coming apart. Also, because the rules only use information
local to each cell the simulation can run very quickly. 
<p>
One interesting implication of the rules is that long loops and chains of cells cannot be broken,
because each cell maintains connectivity with the ones around it. However, loops can
establish themselves because the notion of connectivity is determined only by who each cell is
next to. This means that if a small creature is <i>swallowed</i> by a larger one then it
can never escape! The applet on the front page demonstrates this sometimes.
